Rabbitode is a probject created to provide a simple interface in order to work with the AMQP interface to rabbitmq.
RabbitMQ  is an events broker that allows us to send a recieve events between producers and consumers via an event queue.

# Installation
- Installation via npm `npm install rabbitode`
## Requirements
In order for this project to run you must have a working instance of rabbitmq on your machine or server.
I reccomend docker for local development.
```docker run -p 5672:5672 -d --rm --name rabbit rabbitmq:3```

# Api
## Creating a connection
```typescript
    import { RabbitMqInterface } from 'rabbitode';
    const myConnection = new RabbitMqInterface();
    
    myConnection.setRabbitUri('http://myconnection')
    
    const handleConsume = channel => msg => {
      console.log(myConnection.decodeToString(msg))
      channel.ack(msg);
    };
    
     myConnection.sendDirect({
        exchangeName: 'direct_test_exchange',
        routingKey: `direct_test_queue`,
        content: {
          message: `this is a direct test message`
        }
      });
       
      myConnection.startDirectConsumer({
          exchangeName: 'direct_test_exchange',
          exchangeType: 'direct',
          queueName: 'direct_test_queue',
          consumerCallback: handleConsume,
      });
```

## API
#### Send Direct
```typescript
rabbitInterface.sendDirect({
    exchangeName: 'direct_test_exchange',
    routingKey: `direct_test_queue`,
    content: {
      message: `this is a test message for direct stuff ${variable}`
    }
  });

```
#### Send Fanout
```typescript
rabbitInterface.sendFanout({
    exchangeName: 'fanout_test_exchange',
    routingKey: ``, // leave this blank with a fanour
    content: `this is a test message for fanouts: ${count}` 
    // will return undefined with decodeToJSON as its a string
});
```
#### Send Topic
```typescript
rabbitInterface.sendTopic({
    exchangeName: 'topic_test_exchange',
    routingKey: `test.test`,
    content: `this is a test message for topics: ${count}`
  });
```
#### Consumer Direct
```typescript
rabbitInterface
  .startDirectConsumer({
    exchangeName: 'direct_test_exchange',
    exchangeType: 'direct',
    queueName: 'direct_test_queue',
    consumerCallback: handleConsume,
});
```

#### Consumer Fanout
```typescript
rabbitInterface
  .startFanoutConsumer({
    exchangeName: 'fanout_test_exchange',
    exchangeType: 'fanout',
    queueName: '',
    consumerCallback: handleConsume,
  });

```
#### Consumer topic
```typescript
// the topics this consumer will listen for given in the routing key
const myTopics = ['test.*', '*.test'];
rabbitInterface
    .startTopicConsumer({
        exchangeName: 'topic_test_exchange',
        exchangeType: 'topic',
        consumerCallback: handleConsume,
    }, myTopics);
```
#### Consumer Handler
```typescript
//MUST CONTAIN CALLBACKS
const handleConsume = channel => msg => {
  console.log(rabbitInterface.decodeToString(msg));
  console.log(rabbitInterface.decodeToJson(msg));
  //console.log(msg.fields.routingKey); topics only really
  channel.ack(msg);
};

```
#### Set custom uri
```typescript

myConnection.setRabbitUri('http://mylocation');

```
#### Enable debugging
```typescript

myConnection.enableDebugging();

```

#### Disable debugging
```typescript

myConnection.disableDebugging();

```

#### Decode to JSON
##### will check if message content is JSON or Return undefined
```typescript

myConnection.decodeToJson(message);

```
#### Decode to String
```typescript

myConnection.decodeToString(message);

```

# Changes
### v-2.0.0
 - Most methods return this to enable method chaining 
 - send method no longer available, use sendDirect, sendTopic, sendFanout instead
